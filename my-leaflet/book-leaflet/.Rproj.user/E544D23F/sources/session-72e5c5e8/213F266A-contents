# Conclusion

Now here comes the end of our book. If you have reached this far, then congratulations! You now have the power to continue using Leaflet to create cool webmaps, even far better than those you've encountered in this book.

I hope this book has been helpful. For anything that you found difficult to understand, or the text lacked sufficient clarity, it had nothing to do with you. Totally. The author wishes they could explain everything concisely, succinctly, sweetly and clearly as though they were composing a poem. Nevertheless, it is the author's desire he could intuitively explain concepts from the computing world as easily as he could geographical and GIS matters.

*Finis!*
