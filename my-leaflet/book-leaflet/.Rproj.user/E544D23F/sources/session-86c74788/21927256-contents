# Preface {-}

This book was written to assist the budding GIS specialist, geographer or cartographer who has an interest in quickly learning how to create webmaps with minimal knowledge of JavaScript. The aim of this book is to bring the learner up to speed on how to create almost any kind of webmap using Leaflet. Written from the point of a self-taught programmer, this is more of a guide book on how to navigate the Leaflet JavaScript syntax at intermediate level. Nevertheless, it is the wish of this writer that the book appetites you to go deeper in using programming for not only Geographical Information Systems (GIS) purposes, but for any other purpose that fascinates your mind. 

## Usage{-}

Although the author would highly recommend the reader to sequentially go through the entire book, for the hasty learner, each chapter from Chapter 3 onwards is a stand alone exercise with a link to the source code at the end of every chapter. The link can be found just before the **Summary** subsection. Finally, the book is also available as a Portable Document File (PDF) here.

## About the Author {-}

Samuel Gachuhi Ngugi is a graduate of the University of Nairobi holding a Bachelor of Arts degree in Geography and Environmental Studies. He also holds a certificate in Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in addition to certifications in Google Earth Engine, Site Planning and Machine Learning for Weather and Climate from the European Commission for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) among others. He began to gain an interest in programming in 2021. His first programming book was [*A Beginner Friendly Introduction to GIS Operations in R: A practical guide*](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/365301997_A_Beginner_Friendly_Introduction_to_GIS_Operations_in_R_A_practical_guide) published in 2022. Prior to this he had also published a GIS tutorial book entitled [*Basic Raster and Vector Operations using Qgis: A tutorial*](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341343109_BASIC_RASTER_AND_VECTOR_OPERATIONS_USING_QGIS_A_TUTORIAL) in 2020. Both have been warmly received by the academic community.
