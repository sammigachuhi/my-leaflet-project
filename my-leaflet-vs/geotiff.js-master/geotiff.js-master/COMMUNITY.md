# Community Packages

Here is a list of community packages that use or extend the functionality of the core geotiff library.
- [geotiff-stats](https://github.com/geotiff/geotiff-stats): JavaScript package for computing basic statistics (e.g., min and max) for geotiffs, especially in a low-memory environment.
- [geotiff-palette](https://github.com/GeoTIFF/geotiff-palette): JavaScript package for getting the palette (aka Color Map) for a geotiff.
- [geotiff-geokeys-to-proj4](https://github.com/matafokka/geotiff-geokeys-to-proj4): JavaScript package for converting GeoTIFF's geokeys to Proj4 string, so images could be reprojected and consumed correctly.
- [geotiff-precise-bbox](https://github.com/geotiff/geotiff-precise-bbox): JavaScript package for getting the most precise bounding box for a GeoTIFF image.  It avoids floating-point arithmetic errors by using [preciso](https://github.com/danieljdufour/preciso) and storing numbers as strings.
- [geotiff-tile](https://github.com/GeoTIFF/geotiff-tile): JavaScript package for generating a map tile from a geotiff for nearly any standard extent or projection
